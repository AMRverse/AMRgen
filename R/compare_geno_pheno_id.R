#' Compare Genotype and Phenotype Data by Sample ID
#'
#' This function compares genotype (`geno_data`) and phenotype (`pheno_data`) datasets based on their sample IDs. It identifies sample IDs that are unique to either dataset, as well as those that overlap. Optionally, it renames the sample ID columns in both datasets for consistency.
#' @param geno_data A data frame containing the genotype data. The first column (or the column specified by `geno_sample_col`) should represent sample IDs.
#' @param pheno_data A data frame containing the phenotype data. The first column (or the column specified by `pheno_sample_col`) should represent sample IDs.
#' @param geno_sample_col A string specifying the name of the column in `geno_data` that contains the sample IDs. Defaults to the first column of `geno_data`.
#' @param pheno_sample_col A string specifying the name of the column in `pheno_data` that contains the sample IDs. Defaults to the first column of `pheno_data`.
#' @param rename_id_cols A logical value indicating whether to rename the sample ID columns in both `geno_data` and `pheno_data` to "id". Defaults to `FALSE`.
#' @importFrom dplyr any_of filter pull rename
#' @return A list containing:
#' - `pheno_unique`: A vector of sample IDs that are unique to the phenotype dataset.
#' - `geno_unique`: A vector of sample IDs that are unique to the genotype dataset.
#' - `overlap_ids`: A vector of sample IDs that are common to both datasets.
#' - `geno_matched`: A data frame of the genotype data filtered to only include the samples with matching IDs.
#' - `pheno_matched`: A data frame of the phenotype data filtered to only include the samples with matching IDs.
