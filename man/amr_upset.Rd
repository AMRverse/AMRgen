\usage{
amr_upset(
  binary_matrix,
  min_set_size = 2,
  order = "",
  plot_set_size = FALSE,
  plot_category = TRUE,
  print_category_counts = FALSE,
  print_set_size = FALSE,
  boxplot_colour = "grey",
  assay = "mic"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{binary_matrix}{A data frame containing the original binary matrix output from the \code{get_binary_matrix} function. Expected columns are an identifier (column 1, any name), \code{pheno} (class sir, with S/I/R categories to colour points), \code{mic} (class mic, with MIC values to plot), and other columns representing gene presence/absence (binary coded, i.e., 1 = present, 0 = absent).}

\item{min_set_size}{An integer specifying the minimum size for a gene set to be included in the analysis and plots. Default is 2. Only genes with at least this number of occurrences are included in the plots.}

\item{order}{A character string indicating the order of the combinations on the x-axis. Options are:
\itemize{
\item "" (default): decreasing frequency of combinations
\item "genes": order by the number of genes in each combination
\item "value": order by the median assay value (MIC or disk zone) for each combination.
}}

\item{plot_set_size}{Logical indicating whether to include a bar plot showing the set size (i.e., number of times each combination of markers is observed). Default is FALSE.}

\item{plot_category}{Logical indicating whether to include a stacked bar plot showing, for each marker combination, the proportion of samples with each phenotype classification (specified by the \code{pheno} column in the input file). Default is TRUE.}

\item{print_category_counts}{Logical indicating whether, if \code{plot_category} is TRUE, to print the number of strains in each resistance category for each marker combination in the plot. Default is FALSE.}

\item{print_set_size}{Logical indicating whether, if \code{plot_set_size} is TRUE, to print the number of strains with each marker combination on the plot. Default is FALSE.}

\item{boxplot_colour}{Colour for lines of the box plots summarising the MIC distribution for each marker combination. Default is "grey".}

\item{assay}{A character string indicating whether to plot MIC or disk diffusion data. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item "mic": plot MIC data stored in column \code{mic}
\item "disk": plot disk diffusion data stored in column \code{disk}
}}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{plot}: A grid of plots displaying: (i) grid showing the marker combinations observed, MIC distribution per marker combination, frequency per marker and (optionally) phenotype classification and/or number of samples for each marker combination.
\item \code{summary}: A data frame summarizing each marker combination observed, including median MIC (and interquartile range), number of resistant isolates, and positive predictive value for resistance.

\description{
This function generates a set of visualizations to analyze AMR gene combinations, MIC values, and gene prevalence from a given binary matrix. It creates several plots, including MIC distributions, a bar plot for the percentage of strains per combination, a dot plot for gene combinations in strains, and a plot for gene prevalence. It also outputs a table summarizing the MIC distribution (median, lower, upper) and number resistant, for each marker combination.
