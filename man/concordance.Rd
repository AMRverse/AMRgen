\usage{
concordance(
  binary_matrix,
  markers = NULL,
  exclude_markers = NULL,
  ppv_threshold = NULL,
  solo_ppv_results = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{binary_matrix}{A data frame output by \code{\link[=get_binary_matrix]{get_binary_matrix()}}, containing
one row per sample, columns indicating binary phenotypes (\code{R}, \code{I}, \code{NWT})
and binary marker presence/absence.}

\item{markers}{A character vector of marker column names to include in a
new binary outcome variable \code{genotypic_prediction}.
Default \code{NULL} includes all marker columns.}

\item{exclude_markers}{A character vector of marker column names to exclude
from the genotypic prediction. Applied after \code{markers} filtering.}

\item{ppv_threshold}{A numeric PPV threshold (0-1). Markers with solo PPV
below this value are excluded. Requires \code{solo_ppv_results}.}

\item{solo_ppv_results}{Output of \code{\link[=solo_ppv_analysis]{solo_ppv_analysis()}}, used for PPV-based
marker filtering when \code{ppv_threshold} is set.}

\item{truth}{A character vector specifying the phenotypic truth column(s) to
evaluate: \code{"R"} (resistant vs susceptible/intermediate), \code{"NWT"}
(non-wildtype vs wildtype), or \code{c("R", "NWT")} (default) to evaluate both.}

\item{prediction_rule}{The rule for generating genotypic predictions:
\code{"any"} (default) predicts positive if any marker is present (after applying filters as specified by \code{markers}, \code{exclude_markers}, \code{ppv_threshold}, \code{pval_threshold}, \code{min_count});
\code{"all"} predicts positive only if all markers are present (after applying filters as specified by \code{markers}, \code{exclude_markers}, \code{ppv_threshold}, \code{pval_threshold}, \code{min_count});
a positive integer predicts positive if at least that many markers are present (after applying filters as specified by \code{markers}, \code{exclude_markers}, \code{ppv_threshold}, \code{pval_threshold}, \code{min_count});
\code{"logistic"} uses a logistic regression model from \code{logreg_results} to predict outcomes for each sample.}

\item{min_count}{An integer or \code{NULL}. Exclude markers with total frequency
(column sum in binary_matrix) below this value. Default \code{NULL} (no filtering).}

\item{logreg_results}{Output of \code{\link[=amr_logistic]{amr_logistic()}}. Used for p-value filtering
(when \code{pval_threshold} is set) and for \code{prediction_rule = "logistic"}.}

\item{pval_threshold}{A numeric p-value threshold. Exclude markers with
logistic regression p-value >= this value. Requires \code{logreg_results}.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{"amr_concordance"}, a list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{conf_mat}: Named list of yardstick confusion matrix objects (e.g.
\verb{list(R = <cm>, NWT = <cm>)}).

\item \code{data}: The input binary matrix with added \code{R_pred} and/or \code{NWT_pred} columns.
\item \code{markers_used}: Named list of character vectors of markers used per outcome.

\description{
Compares genotypes (presence of resistance markers) to observed phenotypes
(resistant vs susceptible) using a binary matrix from \code{\link[=get_binary_matrix]{get_binary_matrix()}}.
A genotypic prediction variable is defined on the basis of presence of
genotype markers (either any marker in the input table, or those defined by
an input inclusion list or exclusion list). This genotypic prediction is then
compared to the observed phenotypes using standard classification metrics
(via the \code{yardstick} pkg) and AMR-specific error rates (major error, ME
and very major error, VME) per ISO 20776-2 (and see
\href{https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/guidance-documents-medical-devices-and-radiation-emitting-products/antimicrobial-susceptibility-test-ast-systems-class-ii-special-controls-guidance-industry-and-fda}{FDA definitions}.
Supports evaluating both R and NWT outcomes
in a single call, with flexible prediction rules and marker inclusion options.
}
\details{
The function identifies marker columns as all columns not in the reserved set
(\code{id}, \code{pheno}, \code{ecoff}, \code{R}, \code{I}, \code{NWT}, \code{mic}, \code{disk}). It then applies
filtering in order: inclusion list \code{markers}, exclusion list \code{exclude_markers}, \code{min_count},
\code{ppv_threshold} filtering, then \code{pval_threshold} filtering.

Marker filtering is performed per outcome (R, NWT), since PPV-based and
p-value-based filters are category/outcome-specific.

Standard metrics (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, kappa,
F-measure) are calculated using pkg \code{yardstick}. AMR-specific error rates are
computed internally:
\itemize{
\item \strong{VME} (Very Major Error): FN / (TP + FN) = 1 - sensitivity. Proportion of
truly resistant isolates not predicted as such from genotype.
\item \strong{ME} (Major Error): FP / (TN + FP) = 1 - specificity. Proportion of
truly susceptible isolates incorrectly predicted resistant from genotype.
